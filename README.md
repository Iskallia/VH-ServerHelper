# Vault Hunters Server Helper

This script is meant to help you setup a local server on your machine.


## Setup

1. To start, please go to the [CurseForge page](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/vault-hunters-1-18-2) and download the **server files** for Vault Hunters.
2. Extract the ZIP
3. Download the setup.bat file from this repository
4. Place the setup.bat file in the same directory as the server files that you just unzipped
5. Run the setup.bat script, and it will install all forge dependencies and start the server for you!


## Running the Server

The script will automatically run the server once it has installed all if its requirements, however, when running the server in the future, you will find a "run.bat" script (and a "run.sh" script) which you can use to start your server.

## Additional Options

If you would like to change the JVM arguments for your server, you can adjust these in the `user_jvm_args.txt` file.
